# daily-shows

Modify the config_example.rb file and rename it to config.rb

Run the binary ./bin/run to pull the last episodes. If you want to repeat a past day, you can set an offset (./bin/run <offset>) that will start pulling episodes from that many days ago.

Another binary is provided (./bin/dl). Passing a show name and episode as a parameter, it tries to download it. Example: *dl The Big Bang Theory S08E01*
